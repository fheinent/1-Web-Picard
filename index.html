            <h2>Main events in his life</h2>
            <p id="events">Short summary of this great man's life and his contributions to the Federation:</p>
            <div class="biography">
                <ul>
                    <li>He was born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in La Barre, France, on 13 July 2305.</li>
                    <li>The young Picard failed his first Starfleet Academy entrance exam, and, upon admission, met with
                        numerous ethical/scholastic difficulties during his cadet career, but went on to flourish.</li>
                    <li>He developed a lifelong passion for archaeology and became the first freshman to win the Academy
                        marathon.</li>
                    <li>Shortly after graduation, Picard was stabbed in the heart by a Nausicaan, leaving the organ
                        irreparable and requiring replacement with a parthenogenetic implant.</li>
                    <li>After graduation forn the Academy, he served shortly on the USS Reliant. Not much in known about
                        that time in his life.</li>
                    <li>Picard eventually served on the USS Stargazer, reaching a command position after other senior
                        officers died during battle. He then served as captain of that vessel for nearly 20 years until
                        the ship vas destroyed in a battle with a Ferengi ship.</li>
                    <li>During that time at the Stargazer, he performed a warp-speed battle tactic that would become
                        known as the Picard Maneuver.</li>
                    <li>There are some dark years between the loss of the Stargazer and Picard's command of the
                        Enterprise. However, it seems clear Picard enjoyed command over at least one other ship in that
                        time span.</li>
                    <li>He assumed command and remained captain of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) until its destrution
                        (the followwing ship under his command is USS Enterprise-E).</li>
                    <li>Years later Picard was assimilated by the Borg to serve as a bridge between humanity and the
                        Borg (renamed Locutus of Borg).</li>
                    <li>Having being restored to health as a human (although some traumatic memories remain), Picard
                        keeps exploring the Universe and achieves the rank of Almirald.</li>
                    <li>Nearly at the end of his carrer, he discovers a star about to collapse near the Romulan home
                        wold. He tries to evacuate the many billion inhabitants of the planet before que explosion but
                        political burocacy and a terrorist attack by androids on Mars prevent that from happening. After
                        a devastationg failure and billions on lives lost, he retires to his chateau in France to spend
                        the final years of his existante... or may be not... :)</li>
